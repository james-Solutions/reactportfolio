# React Portfolio Website
This is a create react app that has been made into a portfolio for programmers and web designers in general. It contains a basic landing page, about page, work page and contact page. A blog portion will be added soon with an admin control panel. 

## To begin using
First get the node modules with 
```
npm install
```
Then you can begin the local server by running
```
npm start
```
Which will open the default browser to localhost:3000 on your machine. Note, that the Google Firebase and ReCaptcha won't function as I took my keys out upon uploading.
